# synthea

## What is it?

synthea is a tool to define retro music in a text file and generate audio. This is inspired from an attempt to recreate the *Stranger Things* [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th29zm5u8yM) from a text file.

## What's planned?

- Implementing basic sound sources
- Pluggable sound sources and filters in `lua`
- PCM audio output
- Better resampling (Lanczos)
